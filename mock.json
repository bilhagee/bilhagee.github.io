        "contentDescription": "When John and Michelle Phillips decided they wanted to start a band in the early 60s, they thought first of a guy – or rather the voice of a guy – that they’d heard sing while they were on a Hootenanny tour in the southern U.S.  They’d heard that his group, the Halifax 3, had just broken up. The Phillips’ put out word that they wanted to get in touch.  Not long after, Denny Doherty showed up on their doorstep. They sang together that day and by the end of it, the Phillips’ knew they had the foundation of their new group. “Denny’s voice really was what started to create a sound we loved,” Michelle said in a documentary made for PBS to celebrate the beautifully layered harmonies of the Mamas and the Papas 40 years later.  It was Doherty who lobbied John to have his friend Cass Elliot join the group to create what he called “Harvey — the 5th voice that was created when the four of us sang together.”  Coupled with John’s imaginative songs, they created the blend of nuanced harmonies and stunning vocal arrangements that earned the Mamas and Papas a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. The group only lasted two-and-a-half years, but nothing evokes the 60s era of love and peace and San Francisco quite as quickly as their California sound."

Millions of jazz fans can tell from just a few notes that they are listening to Oscar play piano — his sense of time, his phrasing, his command and his vitality — they all signify that you are listening to “the Maharaja of the piano” as Duke Ellington famously called him.  Peterson was born in Montreal, was unveiled to the world by his great friend and producer Norman Granz at Carnegie Hall in September 1949 and was embraced by the international jazz community in a career that spanned six decades — and spawned a legacy that is unmatched by any other Canadian jazz player and few other musicians anywhere in the world."
